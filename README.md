# Sorting Algorithms

Python implementations for widely known sorting algorithms.\
Open the Table of Contents (top-left) for complete list.

Implementing the sorting algorithms as a part of re-learning and making a modular source available for future usages.

If you need a specific type of sort, copy and paste the specific function from the `sorts.py` file to your code.\
Or add the `sorts.py` file to your project folder as a module file to get access to all the implementations.

For timing the sorting algorithms, run the `main.py` file with your intended algorithm


## ToDo:
* Add links and pdf files explaining each sorting algorithm
